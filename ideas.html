<div align=justify>&dagger; <b>Ideas</b> --<br><br>
The following sites are merely ideas that I have, they are not necessarily going to the web, but then again they might if I don't have conflicts in making them. Due to school and such, they might not even be shown until the next few years. Nevertheless, here are a few ideas so you can see what's hopefully going to be coming. XD<br><br>

<b>As of</b>: summer 2006<br><b>Status:</b> tentative<br><br>A big maybe, but a possible tribute of some kind to the anime & manga series, <b>Honey & Clover</b>.

» :: <b>Tokyo Babylon Adoptions</b></a></td></tr></table>

<b>As of</b>: July 14th, 2003<br><b>Status</b>: tentative<br><b>Completed</b>: 100%<br><br>Just as the name hints, I'm thinking of a <b>Tokyo Babylon adoptions site</b>, where you can adopt TB characters in all sorts of outfits. If I go with this idea, I'd be constantly adding more sprites in different outfits, but for now, I'm unsure.
