meta.morphosis, a <b>portfolio</b> of design, a creative outlet. Features include a few past layouts, inspirational designs, random doodles, photography, pencil/colored art, as well as miscellaneous designs by me, in various programs.

meta.morphosis was probably the newest site to be launched, as it opened a day after New Year's. It was previously hosted on firedrop.nu, but the domain expired and was not renewed. After a while, I purchased irrelevance.org, and the domain became my portfolio. The reason I didn't want to host it at aiNET was because it was more personal, and had nothing to do with anime/manga. Since aiNET is solely an anime/manga domain, I'd rather have the portfolio somewhere else. After the move to the new domain, I worked out a organized layout format and separated my works, categorizing by the type of media/graphics program I used.

Lately, I've been growing more and more fond of designing non-anime works in various programs and taking photography. The site's still young, and I'm constantly adding new works. It's not updated as much anymore due to my studies, but nevertheless, I try to pull out some time every now and then to design a new piece.
