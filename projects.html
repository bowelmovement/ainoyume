<div align=justify>&dagger; <b>Projects</b> --<br><br>
As always, I have many unfinished projects that I want to put up. These are sites that I'm currently working on, but still unavailable for viewing just yet. When they are finished, I'll post them on the websites section. But this section is for viewers to get a sneak peak at what's coming. These are assorted relatively for what's going to come the most recently to the least likely to appear on the web. <br><br>

<b>Version:</b> 0.0<br><b>Completed:</b> 0%<br><b>Status:</b> planning stages<br><br>A sizeable tribute to the hysterically hilarious anime & manga series: <b>Ouran Koukou Host Club</b>. I won't go into details on the specific sort of tribute, but it's certainly under the presumption to expand continuously.

<b>Version:</b> 1.0 - THISISADDICTION<br><b>Completed:</b> 65%<br><b>Status:</b> constantly updating anime and manga images<br><br>If I get the time, I will be updating this <b>Gravitation image gallery</b> into a more update-friendly site. Athough ADDICTION is considered to be part of Dare to Dream, it's big enough to count as a separate site.
