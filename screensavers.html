<div align=justify>&dagger; <b>Screensavers</b> --<br><br> 
I've made some screensavers featuring various AinoyumeNET designs. Some are simply a collection of my wallpapers, others are designs I've made specifically for this section. They're all in ZIP format. Enjoy! <br><br>

My first screensaver, featuring most, but not all of the wallpapers featured in the <a href="wallpapers.html">Wallpapers</a> section. Also features the background music "Pretty With a Pistol," arranged by Yoko Kanno and heard in the Cowboy Bebop movie. You can change the settings as you please (i.e. Music on/off, sequence, seconds between intervals, etc).
