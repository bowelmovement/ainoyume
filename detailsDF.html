Technically, Demonic Fiend was supposed to be the third oldest site on aiNET. However, due to negligence, the site didn't officially debut until 2002. DF is a tribute to the demon <b>Xelloss</b> from <b>Slayers</b>. Currently, it resides with the <a href="http://mazoku.org" target="_blank">mazoku.org</a> family. :D

I neglected the shrine for about a year, leaving it in its temporary Geocities location, static, and not quite done. Perhaps the main reason why I chose to neglect it for so long was because I highly disliked the <i>size of the text box</i> on the current layout at the time. *laughs* It was rather small, and I seem to have an affinity with large text boxes. About a year later, I half-heartedly tried to pick a nicer place where DF could be hosted, and found one. I had no intention of making it better, so I left it as it was. Fortunately, aiNET was purchased shortly after, and I suddenly had the urge to revamp Demonic Fiend after making a Xelloss wallpaper. This time, I made sure the text box was quite big, and settled DF into aiNET. Not long after, DF moved into an all-Slayers domain, mazoku.org, where it continues to reside today.

Xelloss is possibly my favorite "male" character of all time. I use the term 'male' losely, because as a demon, he has no gender. XD I love Xelloss's personality, how he can be highly amusing and tricky one minute, and deliciously evil the next. The shrine was made purely out of love for the two-faced demon, and I still adore the character to this day.
