One Dandy Tulip pays a tribute to the main character of Pretear, <b>Himeno Awayuki</b>. The shrine is about 75% done, and aiNET's only shrine to the main character from a series.

*scratches head* One Dandy Tulip's debut was a breeze, surprisingly. The main layout didn't match my usual style, and recently, I've begun to hate it. ^^; It took me <i>forever</i> to come up with a decent name for this shrine. Then, I was reminded of a scene in the show one day, matched a few terms up and voila! Not much history on this one, it was pretty much all thumbs up from the beginning. In the future though, I plan to convert the coding into PHP.

In many ways, Himeno reminds me of Tsukino Usagi from Sailormoon. She's always late for school, clumsy, funny, and sort of ditzy. She has a best friend that's a bookworm and she loves to eat sweets. Yet, there are many ways Himeno differs from Usagi. She has a black belt in Tai Kwan Do and she enjoys strange flavored ice cream. --; She's quite a charismatic character, and I love that about her.
