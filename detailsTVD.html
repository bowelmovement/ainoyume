She is Aino Minako, or probably more commonly know as <b>Sailor Venus</b>. Dedicated to this beautiful sailor senshi from the ever-popular series: Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon, Total Venus Destination holds the title of aiNET's oldest site (dating back to year 2000). Featuring 4 sections of information, a separately designed, 200+ image gallery, 80+ Artemis gallery, and more, TVD easily tops other shrines as the most comprehensive single character shrine on aiNET. It is currently hosted by the lovely <a href="http://www.absoludicrous.net/" target="_blank">Sam</a>.

TVD and I been through thick and thin, so to speak. *lol* I remember creating a general Sailormoon site at the beginning. Then, after figuring out that it was going to take a lot more work than I thought, I switched to a shrine to my favorite character, Venus. I was pretty involved in this little shrine, signing up for computer classes in high school just to get a chance to work on it. As I grew, so did TVD. It is the only shrine I've ever submitted to WPR sites, and as a result, have revamped the shrine numerous times. I believed (and still do) that TVD will always be able to improve, so I tried not to neglect the shrine even as my interests in Sailormoon began to fade in time. There were times when I was terribly frustrated with the SM community, but I refused to let the shrine die and watch my years of hard work go down the drain with a few clicks of the mouse. Thus, even today, TVD stands strong, and I hope I can always improve on it.

As I mentioned before, Total Venus Destination is by far, my most comprehensive single character shrine. It was my baby from the start, and needless to say, I'm very proud of it. Surprisingly, I haven't encountered many plagiarists with TVD. Being the oldest site, I had planned on battling direct linkers, plagiarist, and image thieves of all kinds. Fortunately, as far as I know, TVD has been plagiarists-free, with a few minor exceptions. ^^
