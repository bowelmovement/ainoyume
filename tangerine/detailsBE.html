Broken Echo is an extensive shrine to <b>Sasame</b>, the Knight of Sound, from the anime <b>Pretear</b>. Unofficially, Sasame is the first bishounen to grace AinoyumeNET. Sasame is the first character from Pretear that I paid tribute to, and the only shrine that wasn't originally intended to be part of Project: Shirayuki.

Well, Broken Echo is another one of the newer shrines on aiNET, so there isn't much history behind it. By the end of the 13 episode series, I was intrigued by this particular character. My reasons for that are stated in the opinionated portion below. Anyway, BE was launched mid-2002, after I finished the anime. I began with varying layouts for each main section (index, info, media, sitey). I couldn't figure out the proper coding for the index layout. I tried all images, then frames, then centered frames, and finally back to frames. Later, I became fed up with the layout itself and created a much nicer frames layout as the current version. Aside from layout issues, I really didn't have much else to worry about. BE seems to be my most popular Pretear shrine to date.

Pretear's a relatively new anime, but it's pretty well done for a mahou shoujo anime. Something about Sasame flickered an interest. I'm thinking it's the voice. The voice actor for Sasame is just absolutely brilliant. As the Knight of Sound, he must have a great voice, and the chosen voice actor does him so well. But the voice wasn't all. I love complicated characters, you see, and I love ambiguous actions from them. Interpreting their actions as right and wrong, and for what reasons, is half the fun of watching an anime or reading a manga. That was probably what prompted me to make this shrine.
