What would a collective be without memories of the past? Recollection is my <b>layouts archive</b>, where I attempt to keep a memory of all of the layouts I've ever created. The archive harbors only layouts featuring characters from Shoujo Kakumei Utena, because I adore the art of that series. XD

Recollection's another oldie. It holds quite a few memoriable layouts that I would have otherwise forgotten. The first version of this site stayed up for <i>way</i> too long, but it was very pretty at the same time. It only during the second version when I decided to restrict the layouts to be Utena themed, since I've always loved the art of Utena and its twisted characters.

I personally love to see how other people have improved over the years, and I want to keep memories of my past layouts as well. Recollection has proven to be a useful source and a fun place to go to when you want to see how much you've improved and how ugly your layouts were back when you just started out. XD;
