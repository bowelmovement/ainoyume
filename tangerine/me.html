<b>The Short Story ;</b><br><br>

Trinity is a 21 year old girl living in one of the largest cities in midwest US. Highly sarcastic, cynical, stubborn and mildly geeky, she will be obtaining her B.S. in Computer Science at the end of 2006. She has a certain affinity to nature and international culture, as suggested by her food and music tastes. Her online presence extends back to 1999, but now she has claimed a little corner of the net with her collective, ainoyumeNET. Although normally artistically driven with anime/manga, she has also dabbed a bit on the <a href="http://irrelevance.org" target="_blank">professional</a> side of web & graphic design. When she's not on the computer or buried under schoolwork, she is a humerous little girl with a big appetite. Thus at local Chinatowns, you will most likely find her in heated battle for peking duck and pig's stomach, or munching classic dim sum. Oh, and she's also addicted to those little Starbucks Frappuccino Mochas.

I am a <i>large</i> fan of any good, intense action/drama TV series, particularly those that involve government intelligence agency conspiracies and mysteries. Thus I religiously watch <i>24, Alias, CSI</i> (original), and the occasional <i>NCIS</i>, <i>Prison Break,</i> and <i>Monk</i>. But mainly, <i>24</i> and <i>Alias</i>. Unfortunately for <i>Alias</i>, the show is going down the tube. Thus I have shifted my attention to <i>24</i>. However, Jack Bristow can still kick Jack Bauer's ass, anyday. =3

<br><br>

I enjoy Animé/Manga, less so now, but still a decent amount. My expectations have risen, and I don't normally keep up with every mainstream show. However I do occasionally indulge in a bit of <i>BLEACH</i>, and might pick up a series during any spare time. Past series, such as <i>Gravitation, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, Shoujo Kakumei Utena,</i> and <i>Samurai Champloo</i> have successfully retained my interest. I usually have a soft spot and a keen eye for killer CG, overall art/character design, and animation of a series or movie. Thus the <i>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</i> movie is a definite favorite of mine, as well as most <i>Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli</i> films. Manga reading is a lesser passion of mine, but still a strong hobby. My favorite manga will always be <i>Tokyo Babylon</i>, but really, most of CLAMP's works is a favorite.

<br><br>

Speaking of reading, I don't read nearly as much as I did when I was younger. However I still tend to pick up a novel once in a while - usually during long flights half way around the world. =3 Favorites include <i>Watership Down, The Giver, Harry Potter saga, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Flowers for Algernon,</i> and <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>
