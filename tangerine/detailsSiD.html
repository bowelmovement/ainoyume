Slayers in Detail, as the name suggests, is a <b>Slayers</b> screenshot gallery containing only the TRY series at the moment. Perhaps I'll add the NEXT series later, but that's unlikely.

Slayers in Detail was one of my older sites. The debuting version was absolutely <i>horrid</i>. Pity too, that I put forth so much effort in creating <i>individual</i> layouts for all <i>26</i> episodes. 26 layouts! Not only was I getting dreadfully tired of making layouts by the end, most of them were terrible in different resolutions, and there wasn't much organization. Plus, each layout took a large amount of time loading. I particularly remember one layout that covered the entire window. x.x It was really not a very nice site to visit. So once I had time to settle down with aiNET, I proceeded to revamp the gallery by placing it into frames and reorganizing. The new (and current) version is <i>much</i> easier to navigate in and faster to load. I must say, I've learn quite a few things regarding how to manage an image gallery from my experiences with this site.

Slayers is an awesome series to watch. It never fails to bring smiles all around. Although I'm more of a NEXT fan, TRY is also a great season. I wasn't nearly as detailed on the screenshots as I was on the Gravitation screenshots in Addiction, but these were a bit larger and took up more space.
