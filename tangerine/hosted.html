<div align=justify>&dagger; <b>Hosted Sites</b> --<br><br>
The following are all the wonderful sites that are currently hosted on ainoyumeNET. Please visit them as they are not only incredible sites, but they're also owned by incredible people.
<br><br>

<a href="http://onmyouji.ainoyume.net" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='&gt;&gt; &gt;  visit Monolith of Doubt --------';return true"><img src="/images/hostee02.gif" width=88 height=31 alt="geneSIS: Lyn's general site to the anime/manga series: Tokyo Babylon" border=1 align=left></a>
geneSIS, formerly known as Project Sakurazukamori, is one of the best (if not the best - IMO) general site to one of my favorite series, <i>Tokyo Babylon</i>. Her choke-full-of-content site, along with multimedia and fanworks make this site one of the most well rounded sites I've seen. It's my honor to host this lovely shrine.<br><br>

<a href="http://pure.ainoyume.net" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='&gt;&gt; &gt;  visit Pure Heart--------';return true"><img src="/images/hostee01.gif" width=88 height=31 alt="Pure Heart: Windy's shrine to Haku from the anime/manga series: Naruto" border=1 align=left></a>
Pure Heart is Windy's kick butt shrine to the wonderful Haku of Naruto. Containing in depth information on Haku as well as Naruto the series, definitely one of the best Haku shrines I've seen. :3<br><br>

<a href="http://sakurazuka.ainoyume.net" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='&gt;&gt; &gt;  visit Papercut Kisses--------';return true"><img src="/images/hostee03.gif" width=88 height=31 alt="Papercut Kisses: Sakura's Tokyo Babylon/X art site" border=1 align=left></a>
Papercut Kisses contains a glorious amount of delightful Tokyo Babylon/X fanart, focusing on Seishirou and Subaru. As I am a sucker for SxS goodness, I gladly accepted Sakura's submission. ^^<br><br>

<a href="http://glass.ainoyume.net" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='&gt;&gt; &gt;  visit Porcelain --------';return true"><img src="/images/hostee04.gif" width=88 height=31 alt="Porcelain: Kyuu's shrine to Subaru of Tokyo Babylon/X" border=1 align=left></a>
Porcelain is a lovely shrine to one of my favorite characters of all time, Sumeragi Subaru of the Tokyo Babylon & X/1999 fame. Although it's about half way finished, there's still plenty for visitors to do. Spread the Subaru love! =3<br><br>

<a href="http://knight.ainoyume.net" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='&gt;&gt; &gt;  visit White Crown --------';return true"><img src="/images/hostee06.gif" width=88 height=31 alt="White Crown, Inugami's collective featuring mainly TB/CLAMP related works" border=1 align=left></a>
White Crown is Inugami's collective featuring not one, but <i>two</i> Tokyo Babylon sites. *spins* In addition to her collective, aiNET's also hosting her Subaru and Hokuto shrines, her weblog, as well as her portfolio. <br><br>


<a href="http://sd.ainoyume.net/" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='&gt;&gt; &gt;  visit Surreal Delusion --------';return true"><img src="/images/hostee07.gif" width=88 height=31 alt="Surreal Delusion, Chibi Tenshi and ShadowFire's artwork" border=1 align=left></a>
Surreal Delusion is dual owned by Chibi Tenshi and ShadowFire, two inspirational artists who showcase their art on the site. Their art subjects range from Final Fantasy to Harry Potter, to general anime/manga works. <br><br>
