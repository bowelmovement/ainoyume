The most recent addition to the AinoyumeNET collection is an extensive tribute to <b>Rock Lee</b> from the anime/manga legacy <b>Naruto</b>. This shrine is one of the most extensive shrines on aiNET, surpassed only by <a href="http://venus.prettyodango.net" target="_blank">TVD</a> and <a href="http://dream.shounen-ai.org" target="_blank">DtD</a> in terms of content.

Naruto is a great series, but I never really felt connected with any of the characters until Lee came along. Lee is just amusing, hard working, and thoroughly inspiring. For most of summer '04, I didn't focus much on sites. Sure, there was the occasional layout change or small update, but in the beginning of the summer after a hard year at school, I wasn't about to start any big projects. Then, towards the end of summer, I started re-watching Naruto. I had planned on making a shrine to Rock Lee for about half a year now, so I figured I could get started. But the more I typed, the more I wanted to work on the shrine. This shrine was also built after I started exercising my new approach to shrines. I made the information more extensive, and tried to be original. The result, the shrine heavily centers around information and has a pleasant amount of media.

Lee is one of the greatest characters I've had the pleasure of watching, in all my anime years. He's comical and strong, with a great heart and mind. He's the epitome of "don't judge someone based on their appearance." You can really learn a lot from just watching him. This shrine is definitely one I sincerely had fun making.
