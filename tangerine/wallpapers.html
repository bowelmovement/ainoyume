Here are the wallpapers of my favorite layouts. Please do not re-edit them for any purpose, only use for decorating your desktop backgrounds.<br><br>

<img src="/images/miniwall01.gif" align=left style="margin:10px"> <a href="/images/awall.jpg" target="_blank">800x600</a> || <a href="/images/awall1024.jpg" target="_blank">1024x768</a><br> 

Version 4.0 of AinoyumeNET, featuring Aya from Weiss Kreuz. This layout was one of my favorites, so naturally I adore this wallpaper a lot. Aya will look wonderful on your desktop, guaranteed. =)<br><br> 


<img src="/images/miniwall02.gif" align=left style="margin:10px"> <a href="/images/ywall.jpg" target="_blank">800x600</a> || <a href="/images/ywall1024.jpg" target="_blank">1024x768</a><br> 

Version 3.0 of AinoyumeNET, featuring Yohji from Weiss Kreuz. I love this wallpaper to this day, not only because Yohji is my favorite WK assassin, but also because of the colors. Besides, it's Yohji. He'd look good on any wallpaper. XD<br><br> 


<img src="/images/miniwall03.gif" align=left style="margin:10px"> <a href="/images/1wall.jpg" target="_blank">800x600</a> || <a href="/images/1wall1024.jpg" target="_blank">1024x768</a><br> 

This one isn't from one of my layouts, but made simply out of boredom one day. The featured series is Megami Kouhosei. The best thing about this background is the multitude of colors.<br><br> 


<img src="/images/miniwall04.gif" align=left style="margin:10px"> <a href="/images/wallutena.jpg" target="_blank">800x600</a> || <a href="/images/wallutena1024.jpg" target="_blank">1024x768</a><br> 

This Utena wallpaper is the first wallpaper that I didn't make out of my layouts. The quality of this picture is unbelievably nice, so I couldn't resist making a wallpaper out of it. It's mostly pink though.
