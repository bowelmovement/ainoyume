Still one of the newer shrines to grace AinoyumeNET is my tribute to <b>Hinoto-hime</b> from the anime/manga series <b>X/1999</b>. Possibly the only full Hinoto shrine on the net so far, SoD's purpose is to enlighten fans and express my interpretations of her actions in the series. 
<br><br>
<b>t h e &#160; h i s t o r y ;</b><br><br>
As it is still quite young, SoD doesn't have much of a history. I started out with a simple, manga layout, with an unfinished information section. It was sort of neglected for a couple of months, until I decided to give it a much needed makeover. The manga images/layout were the first to go, since I began respecting CLAMP's privacy. It was bloody hard trying to come up with a full anime layout using only screenshots from the series. I fiddled with the layout for days before coming up with something I liked. About twice as much information were added after I rewatched X with a friend. I wanted fans to be able to see Hinoto from a different perspective, to get another side of the story. Nowadays, SoD gets the occasional guestbook compliment, so I hope viewers are enjoying the shrine. ^^

From past encounters, Hinoto seems to be misunderstood by many fans. Thus, she's quite an overlooked character on the net. From my interpretations, she's one of the most significant characters in the series. One of the things I like most about the shrine is its name. It's probably one of my favorite names of my shrines. XD; I really had fun making this shrine, and hopefully I'll have more to add when CLAMP <i>finally</i> manages to end X...and when would that be? We can only wonder. XD
