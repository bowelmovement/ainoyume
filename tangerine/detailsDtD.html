Dare to Dream, often abbreviated DtD, is currently a general site focusing on covering all aspects of the shounen-ai anime and manga, <b>Gravitation</b>. DtD is aiNET's largest and most comprehensive site to date and it is currently part of the shounen-ai series collective: the <a href="http://shounen-ai.org" target="_blank">Shounen-ai orG</a>.

Launched in February of 2002, DtD was only about half way done. The debuting version used frames, which proved to be incompatible with the amount of information I was going to have. Thus, from the second version on, I switched to varying layouts in the information section. A few months later, the lite version of DtD debuted for those with slower connections. Since then, not many drastic changes have been made towards the shrine. But at the same time, plagarization, image theft and the like plagued the shrine. DtD seemed to be a popular source for Gravi fans, not only to look at, but to take as well. To date, DtD has encountered plagiarists from fansites to the official Tokyopop website. Fortunately, most were sincere and complied with requests for the information to be taken down. In the future, I hope DtD continues to be a valueable source of Gravitation to fellow fans. :D

DtD is my baby. ^^ Basically, I poured more heart and soul into creating this site than any of my other sites. Hopefully, visitors would find DtD to be the one stop site for anything Gravi related, and DtD would further promote the wonderful series. I absolutely adore Gravitation. It's hilarious, touching, full of brilliantly composed and catchy songs, and more. It's definitely one of my favorite series of all time.
