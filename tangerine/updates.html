<b>[06.04.06]</b> My <a href="http://bitter.irrelevance.org" target="_blank">weblog</a> is being linked for the first time in several years from the main collective. It's currently under the <a href="personal.html">Personal</a> section of aiNET. I recently converted it from CuteNews to WordPress, and the weblog is skinnable, currently featuring four layouts for you to choose from. I plan to update the weblog about 2-4 times per month, so we'll see how that goes. XD

<b>[05.24.06]</b> No, I'm not dead. -.- An update after <i>two</i> years, we are finally making progress. I am far from giving up this site, thus I'm trying my best to change its image once in a while - even if that means I have to do it once every two years. Now that summer is here, I have a little bit more time to do some updates. Sad as to say, there's not much change content-wise. I did go through and updated some of the paragraphs, took out the more amateur designs on some pages, and added a <a href="me.html">Behind the Scenes</a> section. If you keep up with my <a href="http://ecatalina.livejournal.com" target="_blank">LJ</a> at all, then you might be aware of my vigorous updates and revamps on <a href="http://www.irrelevance.org" target="_blank">irrelevance*org</a> the past couple of weeks. I've been quite interested in LJ icon making for the past year or so. Perhaps I shall upload a small section on that later on. Cheers. =3

<b>[09.22.04]</b> *pauses to reflect that there's an actual update* ^^; <a href="http://www.irrelevance.org" target="_blank">irrelevance*org</a> has received a makeover, featuring some simplistic graphics made at the wee hour (11-12) of the night and coded between work, class and lunch break. But hey, the sketches section has 3 new images. :3
