To this day, Reflection remains the net's only shrine dedicated to the <b>Mirror card</b> from <b>CardCaptor Sakura</b>. In fact, there are virtually no shrines on the web dedicated to the clow cards at all. Reflection is also the second oldest site on aiNET, dating back to mid-2001. At the moment, it is possibly the least active site.

Reflection was created shortly after TVD was finished. At the beginning, as with TVD, I had intended to make a general CardCaptor Sakura site, called "CardCaptor Sakura Fantasy Paradise," or CCSFP. Now that I look back on it, the name was simply too amusing. After only 2 versions, I scrapped the idea and had a brainstorm. After some consideration, I decided to create a clow card shrine. A shrine to The Watery card was my original intention, but that idea was scrapped as well. Finally, the Mirror card was chosen. I had the hardest time coming up with a good design for the site, and went through numerous trial layouts (a clow card layout can be a lot harder than you think. x_x). The site was launched after about 2 months of work. I produced as much information as I possibly could out of the few episodes the Mirror appeared in. Nowadays, I seem to only update with wallpapers. ^^;

What prompted me to make a shrine to a <i>clow card</i>? That may be what you're wondering. Frankly, I adore the clow cards. At a young age, I was easily fascinated by the spiritual world, and seeing the Clow Cards in action were sometimes my favorite part of the show. I liked the way they were drawn, how they were presented, and the mysterious aura they seemed to give off every time they were called. It was pretty hard choosing a favorite, but the Mirror was just so sweet and gorgeous in its own way. So, although Reflection is now partially static, it's still one of my favorite shrines.
