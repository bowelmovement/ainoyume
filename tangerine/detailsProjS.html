Project: Shirayuki is a project co-owned with Marurori and <a href="http://cleverheart.net" target="_blank">Europa</a>. It's a tribute to the anime/manga series: <b>Shin Shirayuki Hime Desetsu Pretear</b>. Though the site itself is in it's finishing stages, our future plans include having individual character shrines as well as a general site, interactivity, and such.

The idea of this large collective was formed in a thread on a message board. Back then, it was only between Marurori and I. The individual character shrines were split between us, and we had planned to create a general site together. As we set to work on our shrines, we found that time was a bit of an issue, as we were both quite busy, and work went slowly. After about half a year, I asked Marurori if it would be alright to have Europa join in on the project, since she was also a rabid fan of Pretear, as well as a close friend of mine. Marurori agreed, and I sent out the invitation. The character shrines that hadn't been done were re-split again between the 3 of us, and we were back on track. Nowadays, progress is going slow but steady. There are lots of ideas that are simply waiting to be put into action. If only we had more time. ^^;

Project: Shirayuki, I admit, is rather large and energy-draining. We're in no rush to get it done, because that's not the point. We try to focus on providing solid, correct information while having a variety of multimedia and other goodies. At the same time, I try to incorporate creativity into the main collective, since I always seem to be the one who ends up designing it. ^^; There is still much work left to be done, and hopefully lots of surprises to come.
