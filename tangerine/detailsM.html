There isn't much to say regarding <i>musa</i>, other than that it's sort of a convenient <b>display and storage journal for 100x100 pixelated icons</b>. At the moment, it features only LJ icons, updated sporatically based on available free time.

Frankly speaking, there is little history behind <i>musa</i>. It was created in late 2005 as <i>_hokuto.livejournal.com</i>, a small but danty journal for any artistic related work. But after Livejournal changed their underscoring system around, this journal needed a new name. I went through a whole list of wishlist names before stumbling across <i>musa</i> as an yet untaken username. Happily, I snatched it up. It was made into a community Livejournal a bit later, as I got tired of having to sign in and out of LJ simply to update.

Icon making is a new, small addiction of mine. I hope for it to grow into a decent collection of useable LJ icons one day. I've sort of waited for something like this to come along. Back in the days, I would always stumble upon images that I would have liked to use in some sort of graphic. But the only thing I could think of then was layouts, and many images were not suited for layout making. So I always had a large collection of images sitting in my harddrive, hoping to be used up. Now I can use all of them. ^^ These 100x100 pixelated squares are surprisingly fun to create and manipulate. They can express a wide range of emotions, and are very handy in self-expression - especially on a personal journal. With all these reasons, it's hard not to get in on the action. XD
