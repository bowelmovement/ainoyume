<div align=justify>&dagger; <b>FAQ</b> --<br><br>

<b>Question 1:</b> Can you link me?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I do not do link exchanges. I tend to link people that I admire and/or my friends. You can drop me a note via a <i>polite</i> e-mail to get my attention, but do not spam me.

<br><br>

<b>Question 2:</b> Can you host me?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Visit the <a href="hosting.html">hosting</a> page for details. I do only occasional invites.

<br><br>

<b>Question 3:</b> Why might you not be hosting?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> There are several reasons, but probably most importantly, I have expectations for my hostees that are generally different from other webmasters who offer hosting. I dislike doing favors for people and feel like it's not appreciated. I expect my hostees to know internet etiquette (i.e. no direct linking, plagiarizing), because I am partially responsible for their actions. A few of my current hostees are here by invitation, and I tend to like that method best, where I can see beforehand if my expectations are met by that particular site.

<b>Question 4:</b> I'm an aspiring webdesigner, what do you use to make your graphics? Can you teach me how you make your graphics?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I make all graphics using Paint Shop Pro 7.02, and very rarely, Photoshop CS2. I do all my HTML in the handy dandy Notepad. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to teach you how to make pretty graphics I'm incredibly busy as it is and I really wouldn't know what to tell you anyhow. My advice is to practice and play around with it, and see what you come up with. Practice makes perfect.

<br><br>

<b>Question 5:</b> Can we be friends / affilates / sisters?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> What is your definition of friends? Usually when people ask that, they either secretly want a favor, wants to use you or are desperate for some sort of help. So, feel free to talk to me and I'll decide. Affiliates, no, because I don't like separating affiliates and sisters, yet I reserve sisters for people I know well. So for sisters, I'm picky and very reserved with who I accept. Unless you are a good friend, please don't ask.

<br><br>

<b>Question 6:</b> Why haven't you answered my e-mail?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I'm horrendously bad with replying to e-mails, especially if they're long. In addition, I am a busy person, like most webmasters/webmistresses. I have an offline life and I try to get back to everyone as soon as possible. Please be patient and I will get back to you if necessary.

<br><br><b>Question 7:</b> Can you make me a layout?<br><b>Answer:</b> Absolutely. <a href="http://ainoyume.net/contact" target="_blank">Contact</a> me and we can decide on a decent price.
