Eleventy-Two is the sometimes neglected <b>weblog</b> of mine. Ironically, it's also the site that I update the most (which shows you how often I update at all ^^;). The occasional entry varies from school activities to rants to opinions. Whatever suits my mood at the time.

This weblog's been through numerous title changes and many more host changes, because I just couldn't stick with one. Initially, it was titled "Modernized." Don't ask, I don't know why I decided the name. I started the blog in Geocities, having no clue that a blogging tool might make my life a lot easier. After I found <i>that</i> out, I switched to Greymatter and moved to a friend's domain. It resided at lightning-angel.net for a few years before it died, and my friend Jay offered me space on sapphiredreams.net. I was around version 3 then, and had just discovered the beauty of layer blending and fading. Some of my more amateur layouts can be found on this blog. At the time, I thought blending multiple images together was the coolest thing since sliced bread. In time, I improved, made many friends, switching layouts almost weekly. Those were the days where I actually updated more than once a day. *shock* I believe it was after I moved to sapphiredreams.net when I decided to rename the blog to "Dedication," for everything I dedicated myself to, and for everyone I dedicate something to. Sounds better, but still, I wasn't entirely satisfied because it was a common name. So, after about a year or two, I came up with a rather funky name. A friend of mine had a shirt that said "Eleventy-Two," and I thought that was pretty unique. I went with that name, because it's out of the ordinary.

The weblog is probably what I update the most often, usually with rants, stories, and opinions. If you get bored or something, check out what's going on in my life. Yes, I am aware that no one says the number 112 as eleventy-two, which was what I was aiming at, to be unique. :P
