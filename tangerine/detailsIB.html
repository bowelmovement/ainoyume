Ice Brat! is currently a shrine to <b>Mannen</b>, the Ice Liefe Knight from Pretear, as part of Project: Shirayuki.

Hm. It took me a while to come up with a title for this shrine as well, but unlike One Dandy Tulip, I still don't fancy this name much. The layout was created using mostly random shapes and layer blending. I was initially aiming for icy blue, but it somehow turned bluegreen in the process. ~_~ Writing information on this little brat wasn't the easiest thing to do, since there isn't much on him. Most of the time, I had to rely on my opinions on him. It's a pity Pretear is so short. ;_;

I adore this kid to pieces. All the younger liefe knights from Pretear are simply <i>adorable</i>. I couldn't decide which ones I wanted to make a shrine to, and finally decided on Mannen as one of them.
