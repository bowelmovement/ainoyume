PULSE is a general <b>message board</b>, shared between <a href="http://cloverpetals.com" target="_blank">Tas</a>, and <a href="http://sapphiredreams.net" target="_blank">Jay</a>, and I, hosted @ CloverpetalsCOM. If you have a habit of being insane or just like to chat and meet new friends, the PULSE forums may be an ideal place for you.

PULSE was created after the 3 of us decided that a message board would be fun to have. We couldn't figure out who's domain to have it on at first, since we all had some domain issues at the time. So, I offered to host it and Jay set it up. It was originally named Doki-Doki, the sound of the heartbeat in Japanese. It was later changed to PULSE (seeing a trend? XD;) because it sounded better. ^^; Later, PULSE was moved to Tas's domain and switched to be powered by phpBS instead of Ikonboard.

PULSE is a title I liked, especially since one of the themes features a graph of a pulse (seen in the hospital). At the moment, it has a small, intimate group of people, which I like. Due to studies however, the 3 of us rarely visit the forum anymore.
