<b>[08.13.04]</b> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~ecatalina/" target="_blank">Serendipity</a>, my formerly private LJ, is now open to public. Realistically, it's still semi-private due to the option of Friends Only entries. It also received a new layout.

<b>[06.15.04]</b> Wiped up a quick layout for the <a href="http://ainoyume.net/contact" target="_blank">contacts</a> page. We're going back to Sailormoon! Just kidding. :P But, I've always loved the featured picture, so I figured I might as well use it instead of letting it sit on my harddrive.

<b>[02.01.04]</b> I sincerely apologize for the massive downtime aiNET received. My host, Endore, went down unexpectedly and many problems arised. For instance, many sites still need to be updated and reuploaded. Many of the member entries in Pink Bunny Love, the Gravitation Fanlisting, were lost. Many guestbook entries and such were also lost. But the better news is, I've transferred to a new host and was able to update some of the shrines. <a href="http://fiend.mazoku.org/" target="_blank">Demonic Fiend</a> receives a brand new layout, and my blog is now off the shrines list. If you wish to get ahold of the new location, feel free to email me with the request. That's about all for this update. Stay tuned for more updates within the next few days!

<b>[01.04.04]</b> <b>HAPPY NEW YEAR!</b> Figured that since it was the new year, I should give aiNET a makeover, bring something fresh into view. Thus, here's Aya Mikage, from the anime/manga Ayashi no Ceres. For those of you with 800x600 resolution, I'm sorry to have to force you into a pop-up. I was too lazy to shrink the layout to fit into that resolution, and the layout wouldn't have looked as good. Anyhow, I've added detailed descriptions to most of my sites as an option, so if you get bored, read up on the history of my sites. XD Also, I expect a few more layouts to go up in the next few days, so stay tuned!

<b>[08.31.03]</b> Added a <a href="screensavers.html">Screensavers</a> section and deleted the Presents section. Also updated the <a href="links.html" target="_blank">Links</a> section. Finally, opened the <a href="hosting.html">Hosting</a> section.

<b>[08.12.03]</b> The Gravi image gallery, <a href="http://cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a>, has been updated with 98 new scans from Volume 06 of the manga. The <a href="http://cloverpetals.com/forum" target="_blank">PULSE</a> forums is back and has moved to CloverpetalsCOM. asylum*nu has been dropped from the personal sites list due to lack of time, but the sites located on the domain will stay.

<b>[08.07.03]</b> <a href="http://112.ainoyume.net" target="_blank">Eleventy-Two</a>, my blog, receives a new layout, one of my prettier ones, in my opinion. <a href="http://archive.ainoyume.net" target="_blank">Recollection</a> has also been updated with the screencap of the new blog layout. Finally, I updated <a href="http://asylum.ainoyume.net/portfolio" target="_blank">meta.morphosis</a> with a new image in the PSP section.

<b>[07.27.03]</b> Back from vacation in Hawaii and we have lots of updates this time. I've switched hosts for aiNET, it's now hosted by <a href="http://endore.com" target="_blank">Endore</a>. As you can plainly see, we also have a new layout. It's about time, ne? That Noir layout lasted for 3 months. I still like it a lot, but it's time to move on. XD This version features Maria from E's Otherwise. She's pretty cool. XD I was originally going to go with a cute picture of Hotaru (BSSM), but decided against it. <br><br>Website-wise, me bored at home has given me much time to updates various sites/give much overdue makeovers. Thus. <a href="http://archive.ainoyume.net" target="_blank">Recollection</a> has been updated with new screencaps and a new layout, featuring Touga (sort of O.o) because he kicks booty. XD More information, new links and a new layout can be found at my <a href="http://hinoto.ainoyume.net" target="_blank">Hinoto</a> shrine. Basically, it got a revamp. :3 <a href="http://shounen-ai.org/dream" target="_blank">Dare to Dream</a> also received updates in both Graphics Heavy and Graphics Light versions, and <a href="http://gravi.ainoyume.net" target="_blank">Pink Bunny Love</a>, the Gravi fanlisting, receives a revamp.
