Host Panic's purpose is to gather <b>domains that offer hosting</b>, to make life easier for people who are looking for a host. This way, both the domain owners and those looking for a host can come to one place and seek out each other.

Anyone who's ever been on a free server can speak from personal experience what a hassle they can be. They can also tell you how awful it can be to look for a decent host. So I came up with the idea of Host Panic (silly name, I know), where domain owners can submit for hostees, and potential hostees can look through them and sign up if they wish. Basically, it's a win-win situation. After about a year, I started getting too busy to update submissions, so I asked Serene to help manage it. And so, the result is what you see now. The list is a pleasant size, just how I wanted it. ^^

Not much to say here that hasn't been said already. I believe it's a lovely idea and hopefully it's made some people's lives easier.
