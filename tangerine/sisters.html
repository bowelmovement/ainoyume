<div align=justify>&dagger; <b>Siblings</b> --<br><br>
Below are the ever-great siblings of AinoyumeNET. Please visit them because they are some of my closest and most respected friends. Please do not ask me to be your sibling site unless you are a good friend of mine. Unlike some sites, I reserve my siblings to be those whom I have the utmost respect for.<br><br>

<a href="http://cloverpetals.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/sistas.gif" border=0></a><br>» <b>Tas</b><br>Tas is one of the first people I met online, and she and I have been friends for decades, give or take some years. =3 She graciously hosts <a href="http://cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a>, my Gravi gallery and she's a huge sweetie. All that, and she's a sucker for shounen-ai/yaoi anime/manga. <br><br>

<a href="http://tokyoskylight.com" target="_blank"><img src="/images/sissapphiredreams.gif" border=0></a><br>» <b>Jay</b><br>Jay-jay remains my only brother site, and the sole reason for this section being called "siblings" instead of "sisters." Jay-jay is my crackbrained slave, xD another close online friend I've known since I came online. He's entertainment alright, our friendship can be best described as full of sarcasm and tough love. <br><br>

<a href="http://leshyae.net/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/siskyuui.jpg" border=0></a><br>» <b>Serene</b><br>Serene is one of my closest online friends, having known her for a very long time. She was my hostess before AinoyumeNET, and even today, she still hosts some of my mp3s. She's also been great in helping me get this domain, and she's a huge fan of CLAMP works. <br><br>

<a href="http://genrou.com" target="_blank"><img src="/images/sistasuki.gif" border=0></a><br>» <b>Tasuki</b><br>Tasuki is an awesome person to talk to and have fun with. She's also a huge Slayers, Sanji (One Piece) and Harry Potter fan, and has some of the best shrines around. Definitely worth a look.<br><br>

<a href="http://immortalised.net/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/sisimmortal.gif" border=0></a><br>» <b>Belinda</b><br>Bel is an amazing, amazing designer and a great person to talk to, as we have quite a bit in common (X fans, anyone?). An inspiring and opinionated writer and an aspiring lawyer, she definitely has my admiration. We've had some crazy times on AIM, and I'm forever jealous of her gorgeous and unique designs.<br><br>

<a href="http://final-dreams.net" target="_blank"><img src="/images/sisfd.gif" border=0></a><br>» <b>Diana</b><br>Diana is another long time friend of mine, as well as a frequent AIM conversation partner. ^^ She's always great to talk to and  vent to. XP We've had some great chat room conversations with fellow siblings and others. So, becoming siblings was only natural. <br><br>

<a href="http://www.midnight-solitaire.net/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/sisms.jpg" border=0></a><br>» <b>Alexia</b><br>Alexia and I met quite a while back, when we were (and still are) both reviewers for a certain long-running <a href="http://windam.net/er" target="_blank">WPR</a>. After she finally grounded her own domain, we immediately became sister sites. She and I are both rabid fans of <i>Alias</i>, <i>24</i>, and anime, just to name a few. She's one of the nicest people I know, so go visit!<br><br>
