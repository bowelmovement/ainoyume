Addiction is actually a part of Dare to Dream, but it's rather big, so it has branched off into a separate site. It is a sizeable <b>Gravitation</b> image gallery featuring a wide variety of images. Images include screenshots from the anime and the OAVs, various artbooks, black and white manga scans, as well as fully colored manga and anime images. It is currently hosted by my dear friend <a href="http://cloverpetals.com" target="_blank">Tas</a>.

In the beginning, Addiction was not in frames and not in PHP, so updating it was quite a hassle. Capturing the screenshots were quite a hassle as well, but time wasn't a problem during summer break. After much thought on organization and fast-loading displaying methods, Addiction was eventually converted into frames and PHP, making updating much easier. The overall theme was always blue, and after only 1 version of a main layout, the idea was scrapped. Now, Addiction features a drop down menu displaying the options. As with most image galleries, image theft is a large issue. And hoho, Addiction's had its share of image thieves and direct linkers, despite the rules clearly stated on the index. Some were friendly, others not so friendly. Unfortunately, several ujournals/livejournals were suspended as a result of refusing to comply with requests. After Tas installed the anti-direct linking script though, the direct linkers slimmed down. Nevertheless, Addiction seems to be a popular stop for anyone looking for Gravitation images.

A collection of images, all bishounen, from my favorite series. Can I resist? Even as the title of the site suggests, it was too tempting. Though scanning and screencapping were sometimes a bit tedious, it was worth it to make this massive collection of images. Hopefully, visitors would go and purchase these artbooks, the anime, and the manga after a glimpse of the wonderful artwork.
